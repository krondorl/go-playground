Even Perfect Number

Given an even number N, the task is to check whether it is a Perfect number or not without finding its divisors.

In number theory, an Even Perfect Number is a positive integer which is even or that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, exccluding the number itself.

An even perfect number can be represented as P * (P + 1) / 2 where P is Mersenne Prime.

A Mersenne Prime is a prime number of form 2q – 1 where q is also a prime number.

For example: if N = 6,
If we choose q to be 2 (prime number) then mersenne prime (P) is 22 – 1 = 3.

Therefore, the Even perfect number formed by the formula is 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6.

Examples:

Input: N = 6
Output: Yes
Explanation:
The integer 6 can be written as  6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Hence, its perfect number.

Input: N  =156
Output: No
Explanation:
The integer 156 cannot be written as a sum of its divisors. Hence, its not a perfect number.

Approach:

Find the square root of the given number to get a number close to 2q – 1.
Find q-1 from the square root of the number and then check whether 2q-1 * (2q-1) gives the number entered. If not then it is not a perfect number, otherwise continue.
Check whether q is prime or not. If it is not prime then 2q-1 cannot be prime and subsequently check whether 2q-1 is prime.
If all the above conditions hold true then it is an even perfect number otherwise not.
